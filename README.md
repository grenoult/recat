# Recat

## What is Recat?
React is a extremely simple web page to load cat pictures from a API called [The Cat Api](http://thecatapi.com/).

The purpose of this is to show how React can be used to load data through Ajax and display it with a bit of user interaction.

## Installation
Just do a `git clone` to get a local copy:

    git clone https://github.com/grenoult/recat.git

Then simply open `index.html` with your browser to play around.
